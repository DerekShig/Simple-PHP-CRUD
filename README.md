# Simple PHP CRUD

I wanted to start learning basic PHP, so I made this simple employee management application. I learned a lot about PHP fundamentals like basic syntax, super-global variables and GET / POST.

Some concepts I applied:
* Partial files using the include function
* Using prepared SQL statements to prevent SQL injection
* Simple server-side form validation

TODO
* Add a basic login system using session and session variables
* Add form validation UI so user know when some input is wrong
* Code refactoring  as I learn more
